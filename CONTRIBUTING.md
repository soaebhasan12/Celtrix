### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear messages.
4. **Test** your changes locally.
5. **Push** to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.
6. Fill out the PR template and describe your changes.
7. Participate in the code review process and make requested changes.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gunjanghate/Celtrix.git
   cd Celtrix
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the CLI locally:**
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
4. **Test template scaffolding:**
   - Use the CLI to scaffold a new project and verify the output.

## Project Structure

- `index.js` – Main entry point for the CLI.
- `bin/` – CLI executable scripts.
- `commands/` – CLI command handlers (e.g., scaffold logic).
- `templates/` – Project templates (MERN, MEVN, T3, etc.).
- `utils/` – Utility modules (installer, logger, project management, etc.).
- `tests/` – Test cases and scripts.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Follow the existing code style (use Prettier/ESLint if available).
- Write modular, well-documented code.
- Add or update tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Keep PRs focused and minimal.

## Example Git Commands

Here are some common git commands you may find useful when contributing:

- **Clone the repository:**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/gunjanghate/Celtrix.git
  ```
- **Create a new branch:**
  ```sh
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- **Check status of your changes:**
  ```sh
  git status
  ```
- **Stage files for commit:**
  ```sh
  git add .
  # or add specific files
  git add path/to/file.js
  ```
- **Commit your changes:**
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Add a clear, descriptive commit message"
  ```
- **Pull latest changes from main branch:**
  ```sh
  git pull origin main
  ```
- **Push your branch to your fork:**
  ```sh
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- **Fetch and rebase (to update your branch):**
  ```sh
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  ```

## Template Contributions

To add or update a template:

1. Place new templates in the appropriate subfolder under `templates/`.
2. Ensure the template includes all necessary files (`package.json`, configs, etc.).
3. Test the template by scaffolding a project and running it.
4. Document any special instructions in the template's `README.md`.
